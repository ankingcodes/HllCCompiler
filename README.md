## HllCCompiler
A compiler for C language written in Haskell.     
Output maybe either in x86 Assembly or ARM Assembly. Preferably ARM because of already created [PyARM-Assembler](https://github.com/ankingcodes/PyARM-Assembler)       

Studying a compiler design book turned out too boring for me. Also, what good is a CS degree if you haven't tried making a compiler ?
